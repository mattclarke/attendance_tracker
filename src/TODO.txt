- map Member to rowdata
- attendances cannot be negative
    - how does the table know attendances are numbers?
- add members manually
- copy data to clipboard
- fix the model to make it more user friendly
- gender (somewhat sensitive - do we really need it?)
- store grading history (it was suggested that it can go in the notes)
- some sort of indication if the number of lessons has exceeded what is required
- indicate if not trained in a while (if is 0 in recent attendance)
    - allow hiding of inactive members
- combo for grade
- how to do dates?
- tests to ensure headers, mappings and member values align
